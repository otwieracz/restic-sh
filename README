NAME
       restic-sh - simple shell wrapper over restic backup program

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
       restic-sh  acts  as a simple wrapper over restic backup program. It has
       no external dependencies (other than restic )  and  is  configured  via
       simple shell configuration file.

       restic-sh looks for config-file-name.conf in /etc/restic-sh

       When there is string all instead of config-file-name , every configura‐
       tion file from /etc/restic-sh with .conf  suffix  is  used,  one  after
       another.  This behaviour is used, for example, in provided systemd unit
       to perfor all user-defined backups regularly.

       Additionally, each repository specified in  configuration  file,  there
       has  also  be  corresponding REPO-NAME.pass file in /etc/restic-sh with
       plain-text password to this repository.

       restic-sh provides systemd service for automatic backups. Provided ser‐
       vice runs every 4 hours.

OPTIONS
       backup Backup all defined datasets

       snapshots [name]
              List  all  snapshots  of  all  defined datasets or for only name
              dataset

       cleanup
              Delete all no longer needed backups  (according  to  rules  from
              configuration  file,  see  sample configuration in EXAMPLES sec‐
              tion)

       unlock Try to unlock all remote repositories, useful in rare  cases  of
              some stale locks.

       prune  Free  disk  space by removing chunks of data not used anymore by
              any of the backups.

       check  Check all remote repositories for inconsistencies.

EXAMPLES
       restic-sh configuration file follows format:

              DEST="rest:http://user:password@host:8000/repo_root"
              DATASETS=( "REPO_NAME:DIRECTORY)" "my_home_repo:/home" )
              LOCKFILE="/tmp/restic-running"

              ## CLEANUP command configuration
              # Always keep last 5 backups
              LAST=5
              # Complete history of last 48 hours
              HOURLY=48
              # One backup each day for month
              DAILY=31
              # For each quarter (12 weeks) , keep one backup every week
              WEEKLY=12
              # One backup every month for 6 months
              MONTHLY=6
              # One backup per year, for 3 years
              YEARLY=3

       In this example configuration, /home directory will be backed  up  into
       rest:http://user:password@host:8000/repo_root/my_home_repo

       Any  repository specification accepted by restic is expected to work as
       expected via restic-sh wrapper.
